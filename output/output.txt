Non Governmental Organization: Meaning and Basic Principle 
The term, "non-governmental organization" or NGO, came into use 
in 1945 because of the need for the UN to differentiate in its Charter 
between participation rights for intergovernmental specialized agencies 
and those for international private organizations. At the UN, virtually all 
types of private bodies can be recognized as NGOs. They only have to 
be  independent  from  government  control,  not  seeking  to  challenge 
governments either as a political party or by a narrow focus on human 
rights,  non-profit-making  and  non-criminal.  As  of  2003,  there  were 
reportedly  over  20,000  NGOs  active  in  Iran.  The  majority  of  these 
organizations  are  charity  organizations,  and  thus  would  not  fall  under 
the category of development-oriented NGOs. In this document the term 
NGO  is  primarily  used  for  organizations  other  than charitable 
organizations.
the category of development-oriented NGOs. In this document the term 
NGO  is  primarily  used  for  organizations  other  than charitable 
organizations. 
A  non-governmental  organization  (NGO)  is  a  non-profit,  citizen-
based  group  that  functions  independently  of  government.  NGOs, 
sometimes  called  civil  societies,  are organized on community,  national 
and international levels to serve specific social or political purposes, and 
are cooperative, rather than commercial, in nature. 
 While the term "NGO" has various interpretations, it is generally 
accepted  to  include  private  organizations  that  operate  without 
government  control  and  that  are  non-profit  and  non-criminal.  Other 
definitions further clarify NGOs as associations that are non-religious and 
non-military.
Two broad groups of NGOs are identified by the World Bank: 
 Operational NGOs, which focus on development projects. 
 Operational NGOs, which are organized to promote particular causes. 
Funding:  
As  non-profits,  NGOs  rely  on  a  variety  of  sources  for  funding, 
including: 
• membership dues 
• private donations 
• the sale of goods and services 
• grants 
Despite  their  independence  from  government, some  NGOs  rely 
significantly on government funding. Large NGOs may have budgets in 
the millions or billions of dollars.
Definition : 
The  World  Bank  defines  NGOs  as  “Private  organisations  that 
pursue activities to relieve suffering, promote the interests of the poor, 
protect  the  environment,  provide  basic  social  services,  or  undertake 
community  development.”  In  wider  usage,  the  term,  „NGO‟  can  be 
applied  to  any  non-profit  organisation  which  is  independent  from 
government.  NGOs  are  typically  value  based  organisations  which 
depend, in whole or in part, on donations and voluntary service. 
The United Nations describes an NGO as: Any non-profit, voluntary 
citizens'  group  which  is  organized  on  a  local,  national  or  international 
level. Task-oriented and driven by people with a common interest, NGOs 
perform a variety of services and humanitarian functions, bring citizens‟ 
concerns  to  governments,  monitor  policies  and  encourage  political
participation  at  the  community  level.  They  provide analysis  and 
expertise,  serve  as  early  warning  mechanisms  and  help  monitor  and 
implement international agreements. 
In simple terms, NGOs can be defined as “self-governing, private, 
not-for - profit organizations that are geared to improving the quality of 
life for disadvantaged people” (Vakil, 1997). 
Working Culture of NGOs:  
 NGOs perform a very important role in helping the needy people.  
 NGOs are of great help in case of natural disaster / calamity like 
earthquake,− tsunami or floods.  
  NGOs act as a link between people and the government which act 
as  a−  communicator,  facilitator  or  active  force  for  solving  the 
problem.  
  NGOs have a significant role in improving the standard of living 
and  reducing−  the  poverty.    NGOs  are  also  contributing  in 
important  research  and  education  for−  development  of  the 
country.
and  reducing−  the  poverty.    NGOs  are  also  contributing  in 
important  research  and  education  for−  development  of  the 
country.  
  NGOs supplements government efforts. Today‟s youth is nation‟s 
future hope.− NGOs play a vital role in education. 
 NGOs  try  to  reach  the  under  privileged  children  and  youth  and 
make sure they get education.   
 NGOs help to bring about sustainable development of the country 
since NGOs− are active in most of the fields that bring about the 
economic and social growth and concern for the environment.  
 Many  NGOs  are  actively  bringing  about  social  mobilization  on 
issues like− empowerment of women, human rights, environment 
concern through campaigns, rallies or workshops.  The corporate
sector   along   with   the   NGOs   are   bringing   sustainable− 
development. 
  NGOs play an important role in CSR activities. NGOs being more 
knowledgeable about social structure and social problems, expert 
advice or assistance of NGOs is very useful for corporate sector in 
executing their CSR activities. 
Principles of NGOs: 
There  are  seven  principles  of  financial  management for  NGOs. 
They  provide  a  high-level  guide  for  trustees  and  senior  managers,  to 
help them make sure that their organisation is using funds effectively 
and that staff are working appropriately.

1. Management: 
The  organisation  must  take  good  care  of  the  resources  it  is 
entrusted  with  and  make  sure  that  they  are  used  for  the  purpose 
intended.  The  board  of  trustees  has  overall  responsibility  for  this.  In 
practice, managers achieve it through careful strategic planning, setting 
up  appropriate  controls,  considering  risks,  and  by setting  up  systems 
that work in tune with the two golden rules of NGO field work. 
2. Accountability: 
The organisation must explain how it has used its resources and 
what  it  has  achieved  as  a  result  to  all  stakeholders,  including 
beneficiaries.  All  stakeholders  have  the  right  to  know  how  their  funds 
and  authority  have  been  used.  NGOs  have  an  operational,  moral  and 
legal  duty  to  explain  their  decisions  and  actions, and  submit  their 
financial reports to scrutiny. 
3. Transparency:  
The organisation must be open about its work, making information
legal  duty  to  explain  their  decisions  and  actions, and  submit  their 
financial reports to scrutiny. 
3. Transparency:  
The organisation must be open about its work, making information 
about  its  activities  and  plans  available  to  relevant  stakeholders.  This 
includes preparing accurate, complete and timely financial reports and 
making  them  accessible  to  stakeholders,  including  beneficiaries.  If  an 
organisation  is  not  transparent,  then  it  may  give  the  impression  of 
having something to hide. 
4. Integrity: 
On a personal level, individuals in the organisation must operate 
with honesty and propriety. For example, managers and trustees should 
lead by example in following procedures and by declaring any personal 
interests  that  might  conflict  with  their  official  duties.  The  integrity  of
financial reports depends on the accuracy and completeness of financial 
records. 
5. Viability: 
Expenditure must be kept in balance with incoming funds, both at 
the  operational  and  the  strategic  levels.  Viability  is  a  measure  of  the 
NGO's  financial  continuity  and  security.  The  trustees  and  managers 
should prepare a financing strategy to show how the NGO will meet all 
of its financial obligations and deliver its strategic plan. 
6. Accounting Standards: 
The system for keeping financial records and documentation must 
observe  internationally  accepted accounting  standards and  principles. 
Any  accountant  from  anywhere  around  the  world  should  be  able  to 
understand the organisation’s system for keeping financial records. 
7. Consistency: 
The  organisation's  financial  policies  and  systems  must  be 
consistent  over  time.  This  promotes  efficient  operations  and 
transparency, especially in financial reporting. While systems may need
consistent  over  time.  This  promotes  efficient  operations  and 
transparency, especially in financial reporting. While systems may need 
to  be  adapted  to  changing  needs,  unnecessary  changes  should  be 
avoided. Inconsistent approaches to financial management can be a sign 
that the financial situation is being manipulated.
Role of NGOs in Rural Development: 
 
Role of NGOs in Rural India: 
 The roles that the NGOs perform today in India are numerous. They are 
advocates,  educators,  catalysts,  monitors,  whistle blowers,  mediators, 
activists, mobilizers (of both men and resources), protectors of human 
rights,  conscientizers,  animators,  and  conciliators.  Notable  is  the  fact 
that these roles are never played in an affable climate in India. NGOs, 
mainly  those  that  perform  advocacy  roles  and  critique  government 
policies,  have  constraints  in  their  working  environments.  Sometimes 
there  are  occasions  in  which  the  organizations  are silenced  by  the 
mechanism  of  co-option.  Allocation  of  grants  in  aid  and  respectable 
positions in government bodies with perks and privileges are being used 
to woo voluntary workers. Co-option can come not only from those in 
power but from other political actors as well, including the opposition, as
to woo voluntary workers. Co-option can come not only from those in 
power but from other political actors as well, including the opposition, as 
happened in some Arab countries. For them, NGOs are instruments that 
can be used for political support and influence.  
NGOs are playing a promising interlocutors role in all development 
activities in existing academic as well as development studies. In recent 
times,  responding  to  Grass-roots  level  initiative  and  voluntary  action 
became necessary to develop the rural areas. The increasing demands 
for  the  NGOs  are  itself  a  response  to  recent  trends  relating  to  socio-
economic issues  and  their  corresponding development  interventions  in 
academic and policy-oriented research. 
"Doing  is  difficult  than  Saying".  Yes,  of  course,  saying  depends 
greatly on the knowledge. But comparatively it requires lesser physical 
energy whereas doing requires extensive physical labour, approach and
determination apart from the strategic application of the knowledge and 
experience.  Moreover,  development  administrators  and  change  agents 
have  to  keep  this  fact  in  mind  while  working  on  any  development 
project/programme  that  require  deep  thinking,  sincere  attempts  and 
extensive  involvement.  Either  organizations  or  individuals  those  who 
know this fact hardly try to make an attempt through short-cut methods 
for the development of their communities or the communities they work 
for.  It  is  only  this  distinguished  quality  of  them attracts  one  to  focus 
their  attention  to  such  organizations  and  individuals  involved  in  social 
uplift of deprived and underprivileged sections of the society. 
There is an urgent need for accepting the changing role of NGOs 
in the implementation of child care, women development, anti-poverty 
and  minimum  needs  programmes.  While  the  role  of  NGOs  has  been
in the implementation of child care, women development, anti-poverty 
and  minimum  needs  programmes.  While  the  role  of  NGOs  has  been 
accepted  in  supplementing  governmental  effort,  still  there  is  general 
confusion  and  lack  of  understanding  on  how  best  they  involve 
themselves  directly  in  the  mainstream  of  development  process.  Now, 
this  is  a  turn  to  recognize  the  changes  that  have  taken  place  in  the 
society  that  there  are  many  other  economically  and social  vulnerable 
groups like small and marginal farmers, agricultural labours, scheduled 
castes and tribes, bonded labours, rural artisans, rural women, etc., who 
also need to be brought in the mainstream of development process.
Role of NGOs in Rural Reconstruction: 
India has a predominantly agricultural base and nearly 70 per cent 
of its population lives in rural areas. Practically after the introduction of 
new  technology  in  every  field  of  human  life  there  is  a  visible  change 
even in the thinking pattern and understanding, but, it is very clear that 
we need a corresponding change in the rural areas too. Such changes 
bring  about  a  better  standard  of  living  and  better overall  economic, 
social  and  cultural  environment,  where  a  rural  folk  can  grow  up,  get 
educated through formal and non-formal system and be good citizens of 
India is called Rural Reconstruction. 
An attempt is made to explain the major role need to be played by 
the NGOs in rural reconstruction and they are indicated as follows: 
 To  supplement  government  efforts  in  implementing  various 
programmes  relating  to  rural  reconstruction  and  development 
projects,
 To  supplement  government  efforts  in  implementing  various 
programmes  relating  to  rural  reconstruction  and  development 
projects,  
 NGOs are expected to mobilize their local resources initiative and 
promote self employment activities in rural areas 
 To  organizing  and  mobilizing  rural  people  for  social  action  to 
create awareness among them,  
 They should build self-reliant for sustainable society by acting as 
mediator between people and government, 
 To help the specific target example women, children, SCs and STs, 
landless agricultural labours and downtrodden people. 
 Act  as  a  supporter  and  partner  of  government  programmes  in 
activating delivery system and in implementing rural development 
programmes etc.
 To   promote   appropriate   technologies   and   conducting 
demonstrations, where and when there is a need. 
 To  generate  self-confidence,  self-help  and  to  enhance  decision-
making capacity among the rural communities. 
 Activating  social  legislations  Acts  like  Dowry,  Minimum  Wages, 
Abolition  of  Child  and  Bonded  Labours,  and  Abolition  of  Female 
Infanticide and AIDS 
 Factor  of  transformation,  concretization  and  improvement  of  the 
living standards and welfare of the poor. 
 They should act as facilitator of development, education, training, 
professionalization, etc.  
 Dissemination  of  needed  information  especially  information 
pertaining to modern agricultural technology as well as appropriate 
technology for promoting eco-friendly industrial activity.  
 To  promote  rural  health,  sanitation,  population  control  family 
planning activities.
The  NGOs  role  is  that  actual  function  played  by  an individual  or 
organization in the relevant unit of society. NGOs are expected to play a 
crucial  role  in  all  conceivable  aspects  of  rural  reconstruction  and 
development. Since India is a country of diverse cultures with different 
languages,  religions,  castes,  customs,  traditions  and  mores  across 
different  strata  of  different  societies  of  various states,  considerable 
achievement is not possible if the basics of development in terms of the 
socio-cultural aspects are ignored in the real development of people of a 
nation.
